  - question: What should the concentration of intravenous fluid be?
    answer: >
      There are three types of intravenous fluid concentrations: isotonic,
      hypertonic, and hypotonic fluids. Isotonic fluids are typically
      administered for fluid and electrolyte replacement. Isotonic fluids have a
      similar concentration to the solutes contained in blood, so they do not
      cause the osmotic movement of fluid into or out of the patient’s
      individual cells. An example of isotonic fluid is 0.9% normal saline.
      Hypertonic fluids have a higher concentration of solutes than blood. They
      are typically used in critical care situations to treat hyponatremia and
      avoid pulmonary edema by relying on osmosis to help remove excess fluid.
      An example of a hypertonic fluid is dextrose 5% in 0.9% normal saline
      (D5NS). Hypotonic fluids have a lower concentration of solutes than blood.
      The goal of hypotonic fluid administration is to move fluids into a
      patient’s cells due to osmosis. Hypotonic solutions are commonly used when
      a patient has severe intracellular dehydration such as during diabetic
      ketoacidosis. An example of hypotonic fluid is 0.45% normal saline
      (1/2NS).
  - question: What is the first-pass effect?
    answer: >
      The first-pass effect is the action that occurs when a medication must
      be first metabolized or broken down prior to entering the blood.
      First-pass effect results in a diminished volume of available circulating
      drug and a subsequent decrease in therapeutic action.
  - question: Where is venipuncture performed?
    answer: >
      Blood collection is commonly performed via venipuncture from veins in
      the arms or hands. The most common sites for venipuncture are the large
      veins located on the antecubital fossa (i.e., the inner side of the
      elbow). These veins are often preferred for venipuncture because their
      larger size increases their ability to withstand repetitive blood
      sampling. However, these veins are not preferred for intravenous therapy
      due to the mechanical obstruction that can occur in the IV catheter when
      the elbow joint is contracted.
  - question: What type of blood can people with blood type A receive?
    answer: >
      Patients with type A blood can receive type A or type O blood, but
      another factor is whether their blood is "Rh+" or "Rh-", indicating the
      presence or absence of the D antigen in their blood. If they are Rh+ they
      can recieve either Rh+ or Rh- blood, but if they are Rh- they can recieve
      only Rh- blood.
  - question: What do blood pressure readings mean?
    answer: >
      A blood pressure reading is the measurement of the force of blood
      against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood through the
      body. Blood pressure readings consist of two numbers one on top of the
      other. The top number is the systolic blood pressure and the bottom is the
      diastolic blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure is the maximum
      pressure on the arteries during systole, the phase of the heartbeat when
      the ventricles contract. Diastolic blood pressure is the resting pressure
      on the arteries during diastole, the phase between each contraction of the
      heart when the ventricles are filling with blood. Both numbers are given
      in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Normal systolic blood pressure is 120
      mmHg or less, while normal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg or less.
